# Frosted-Glass-Login


This is one of my free-time projects I created while learned HTML and CSS. I felt it was important for me to master the markup and styling language. I wanted to create a login only using HTML and CSS. I wanted to give my form a frosted glass effect to compliment the color pallet of the background. I also add a transition to the button. When you hover over the button the color will change.
